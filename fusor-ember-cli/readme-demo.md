# fuser-ember-cli / RHCI demo

This is an online demo of [Fusor](https://github.com/fusor/fusor/) using the [EmberJS](http://emberjs.com/) and [ember-cli](http://ember-cli.com/) frameworks.

Fusor normally runs inside Satellite 6 as a plugin, but this demo only shows the UI and is NOT connected to Satellite 6.

## Differences between Fusor/RHCI UI Demo and working Satellite 6 / Fusor environment

**Menu**

* The real Satellite 6 main nav bar is shown below and the "RHCI Installer" menu is added by fusor. This demo only shows a dummy nav bar wit the two links "All Deployments" and "New Deployment"
